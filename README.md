### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I describe myself as a semi-stack developer with a design background. When I got my start in the software space I was designing and building customer MySpace pages. This was the impetus for my interest in designing web-based experiences which I did for a number of years. My jump over the fence into the development side of the house was prompted by the need to understand why what was built didn't match the experience I designed. I call myself a semi-stack developer becuase I'm always learning a bit more about the entire development ecosystem.

Since then, advances in web technologies have fueled my desire to learn a little bit about everything I can get my hands on. Those of us who could design and develop websites and software were dubbed 'unicorns', but I preferred to consider myself a UX Designer for a number of years.

Here's a little bit of my history:

* **Senior Product Manager** - *[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) (Jan 2020 - present)*

* **Product Manager** - *[Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com) (May 2018 - Nov 2019)*

* **Co-Founder** - *[Campground Booking](https://campgroundbooking.com) (Oct 2016 - Mar 2019)*

* **Senior Product Designer** - *[Chargify](https://www.chargify.com) (Aug 2015 - Mar 2018)*

* **Founder/Creative Director** - *[Tinypint](https://tinypint.com) (Jul 2011 - Jul 2015)*

When I'm not working in the digital world, I enjoy [traveling](https://instagram.com/thewebnomads) and doing a bit of woodworking/leatherworking. I've found that these hobbies help me truly disconnect and engage my mind in different and new ways.
